Write up a map function to allow wires to be drawn
- Initilise grid
- Trace out path for wire 1
- Trave out pah for wire 2
- Check out intersections
- Calculate manhatan distance for each (|x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1| )
- Return distance

How to do grid?
Ada 2D vector type? 
Could just log each positon after each movement into a vector (Hash table?) then compare them.
Then calculate distance for all of these and take the shortest??
